# linter-kondo plugin

This linter plugin for Linter provides an interface to [clj-kondo](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo). It will be used with files that have the "Clojure" syntax. Heavily adapted from the [linter-kondo](https://github.com/rgdelato/linter-joker) plugin by Ryan De La Torre.

## Installation
